    TFT ST7735 example to draw an FFT from audio on an S32K144.
    
    Bugs still exist in TFT fonts.
    
      SOURCES
    
      This library has been derived from the Adafruit_GFX
      library and the associated driver library.
    
      This was also taken and refactored from Github:
      Bodmer / TFT_ST7735

      TFT graphics library for any uC or SoC with open
      implementations on SPI callbacks.
    
      No specific HW implementations are available.
    
      This means: no dependency on Arduino, yay!
    
      New implementation was brought back from C++ to C
      for more compatibility on more environments.
    
      Code cleanup and reordering was also applied.
